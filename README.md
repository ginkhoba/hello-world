# hello-world
first steps intro
new to Github and nearly new to coding, have not done any code in 205 years, so please be patient.
got in here, because i have some probs with the python install in my Linux, and i want to understand the probs to solve them.
so i thought GitHub might be a good place to start learning what i already have forgotten, and may be recover some old knowledge.
please have patience, i am an old guy(nearly 60) and learn slowly. thx
about me? i was born a German, in 61, but i am living in Paraguay, because i cant stand the typical german intolerance, so i left, in 2k5.
lived a while in other countrys in EU, mostly in NL, before i moved to south america in 2k9, which i like very much.
like to do things my way. that is what made me leave germany, they dont like that over there very much, you r supposed 2b like everyone else.
can call me a prepper, but even that i do in my own way, building a little boat to live in on the river here in Paraguay, independent as much as possible.
and since i am long time single, that is an easy thing to do, no responsabilties makes it easy going.
that shall suffice for an introduction.
